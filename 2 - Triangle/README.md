# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

The program allows the use to play a game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in the terminal against a computer opposition. These games can be either 1, 3, or 5 best of series. This means that the game will end if either the player or the computer has won more than half of the possible rounds for the game.

There is built in testing that can be ran using the argument "test" after compiling. Anything else will just play the game normally. The tests check if user input is being interpreted correctly for their turn and if player and computer hands give the expected result.
